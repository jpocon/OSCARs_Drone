# iOS App Development Guide for Autonomous Drone Project

This guide provides instructions for developing an iOS application that controls the camera and 3-D sensor (LiDAR Scanner) on an iPhone 12 or later, which is mounted on an autonomous drone.

## Requirements

1. macOS computer with Xcode installed
2. iPhone 12 or later for testing
3. Apple Developer Account (optional for app distribution)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS. Xcode includes everything you need to create apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

### 2. Swift Programming

If you're not already familiar with Swift, take the time to learn the basics. Apple provides an online [Swift Programming Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).

### 3. Create a New Xcode Project

Open Xcode and create a new project. Click on `File` > `New` > `Project...` and select the `App` template under the `iOS` tab. Name your project and set up the initial configuration.

### 4. Design the User Interface

Design your app's user interface (UI) using SwiftUI or Storyboard within Xcode. You will likely need a view to display the camera feed.

### 5. Access the Camera

Import the `AVFoundation` framework to access the camera functionality. You'll use the `AVCaptureSession` class to control the camera. Also, request user permission to access the camera. Add a description for the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in your app's Info.plist file.

Here is a basic code snippet to create a capture session:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class CameraController {
    private let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()

    init() {
        switch AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus(for: .video) {
        case .authorized: // The user has previously granted access to the camera.
            self.setupSession()
        case .notDetermined: // The user has not yet been asked for camera access.
            AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: .video) { granted in
                if granted {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self.setupSession()
                    }
                }
            }
        default:
            // The user has previously denied access.
            return
        }
    }

    private func setupSession() {
        // Configure the capture session.
    }
}
```

### 6. Access the 3-D Sensor

To access the 3-D sensor (LiDAR Scanner), you'll need to use the `ARKit` framework. Specifically, use the `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration` class and check if the `supportsSceneReconstruction` property is `.mesh`. This ensures 3-D sensing is available. Remember to request permission to access the device's sensor data. Include a description for the `NSMotionUsageDescription` key in your app's Info.plist file.

Here is a basic code snippet for checking 3-D sensor availability and starting an AR session:

```swift
import ARKit

class ARController {
    private let arView = ARView(frame: .zero)

    init() {
        let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()

        if ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.supportsSceneReconstruction(.mesh) {
            configuration.sceneReconstruction = .mesh
        }

        arView.session.run(configuration)
    }
}
```

### 7. Develop the App

Develop your app by writing Swift code to implement your app's functionality. This will include controlling the camera, processing images, handling user interaction, and managing data.

### 8.

 Test the App

Use the iPhone simulator in Xcode for initial testing. For testing camera and sensor functionality, you'll need to run the app on an actual iPhone device. Connect your device via USB and select it as the target in Xcode.

### 9. Deploy the App

If you're satisfied with your app's performance, you can prepare it for deployment. To distribute your app to others, you'll need to enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) and follow the guidelines for app submission and review.
