## Introduction

This document provides step-by-step guidance for setting up a DragonBoard 410C running Debian Ubuntu and ArduoPilot, for use in an autonomous drone project.

## Installing the OS on DragonBoard 410C

1. **Download the right Debian image** for your DragonBoard 410C from a reliable source like the 96Boards website.
2. **Flash the Debian image** onto an SD card using a tool like Etcher or Rufus.
3. **Insert the SD card** into the DragonBoard.
4. **Connect peripherals**: Connect the DragonBoard to a monitor, and connect a keyboard and mouse.
5. **Boot up**: Power on the DragonBoard. The board should boot up into Debian and guide you through the setup process.
6. **Connect to the internet**: Configure your network settings to connect the board to the internet.

## Setting up Boot Switches on DragonBoard 410C

The DragonBoard 410c comes with a set of DIP switches (labeled S6) used to configure its boot process. Here are the different switch positions:

- **Switch 1**: ‘USB BOOT’, when set to ‘on’ position, will force boot over USB connection with a PC. This is only required for eMMC boot image upgrade. Please review the proper OS User Guide for more information on this process.
- **Switch 2**:  ‘SD BOOT’, when set to ‘on’ position, will force the SD, J5, to serve as the boot source for the 410c board when set. You can use uSD as the main boot source or it can serve as a method for eMMC boot image upgrade. Please review the proper OS User Guide for more information on this process.
- **Switch 3**: ‘USB HOST’, is described in section 5.8. This switch in not part of the boot configuration.
- **Switch 4**: ‘HDMI SEL’, is described in section 5.6.1. This switch is not part of the boot configuration. 

To boot from the SD Card where you've installed Debian, Switch 2 should be turned ON and the rest of the switches should be OFF.

## Using Laptop or Phone as a Screen for the DragonBoard

Using a laptop or phone as a screen for the DragonBoard involves the use of VNC or SSH for remote connection.

1. **Connect both devices to the same network**.
2. **Set up a VNC server on the DragonBoard**. This can be done using software like TightVNC or TigerVNC.
3. **Download a VNC viewer app on your laptop or smartphone**. For Android and iOS, popular choices include RealVNC, VNC Viewer, and Mocha VNC Lite.
4. **Connect to the DragonBoard**: Open the app, input the IP address of your DragonBoard, the port number the VNC server is running on, and any necessary passwords.

## Setting Up ArduPilot with Bash Script

A [Bash script](https://github.com/jpocon/OSCARs_Drone/blob/master/DragonBoard/DB410C_Setup.sh) can be used to automate the process of setting up ArduPilot on the DragonBoard. Below is an example of such a script.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update

# Upgrade the system
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install some basic packages
sudo apt-get install -y vim git wget curl

# Install the required packages for ArduPilot
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-opencv python3-wxgtk4.0 python3-pip python3-matplotlib python3-lxml python3-pygame
sudo apt-get install -y python3-scipy python3-gdal python3-numpy

# Clone ArduPilot from GitHub
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
cd ardupilot

# Initialize and update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Acknowledgment: ChatGPT-4 Conversation

This appendix includes a complete transcript of the conversation with ChatGPT-4 used to gather information for this project:
https://chat.openai.com/share/73e531f0-4336-45c2-a549-d1f61a17a34c

The above was obtained by interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a state-of-the-art language model as of the time of writing.

**It should be noted that responses from ChatGPT-4 need to be fact-checked. As a generative language model, the responses are produced not by summarizing internet content, but by imitating subject matter language based on the provided prompts. For example, the information generated by ChatGPT-4 about the boot switches was entirely false, which the authors were able to correct based on existing expertise.**
